    "# Iris Analysis\n",
    "In this exercise, I will be using the classic *iris* data set to practice exploratory data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The iris data set contains petal and sepal lengths and widths for three different species of irises. This data is one of the typical first data sets used in learning data science because it contains measures and dimensions that are distinct enough from each other to permit conclusions to be drawn about the different species, but similar enough that the data requires deeper analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will use some of the Python libraries that you will be learning in this course to demonstrate how they can be used in data analysis. The goal of this assignment is not for you to write code, but rather for you to learn to use Markdown instead of inline Python comments since they provide your code with additional formatting options and thus greater readability. As you reformat the comments in this code to be Markdown, I hope that you may also gain an appreciation for how Jupyter Lab works and start thinking about how you will use the libraries that you will learn in your future data analytics projects."
