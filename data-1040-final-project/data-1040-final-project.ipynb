    "# Advanced Python for Data Analytics - Final Project\n",
    "In this final project, you will put together everything you have learned about working with data using Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, in this project you will:\n",
    "1. Use Jupyter Lab, writing code and Markdown in a Jupyter Notebook file.\n",
    "2. Use Pandas to manipulate data.\n",
    "3. Import data into a dataframe using SQLAlchemy.\n",
    "4. Extract text patterns using regular expressions.\n",
    "5. Create visualizations using matplotlib.\n",
    "\n",
    "## About the data\n",
    "This analysis uses the InvoiceLines table from the Sales schema of the WideWorldImporters database. You do not need any other tables or data to complete this project."

    "3. Which products are the most profitable on average (ie. highest ratio of profit to sale price after grouping by StockItemID)? You can calculate profit ratio by dividing the profit by the quantity * unit price.by dividing the profit by the quantity * unit price.\n",
    "4. How many 'white' products were sold in 2014?\n",
    "5. What is the average unit price for products with \"toy\" in the description?\n",
    "6. The tax rate should be expressed as a percentage (ie. between 0 and 1). Modify it to reflect this.\n",
    "7. Create a scatter plot that plots each line item by its LineProfit and ExtendedPrice. Only show items that did not make a profit.\n",

    "#### Quantity of quantities comparison (12 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Grouping each order together, count up the total quantity per order. Then, group by the total quantity per order, counting how many orders have each total quantity.\n",
    "9. Turn this aggregated data set into a histogram that compares the most frequent order quantities.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Slippers color and size comparison (16 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Extract a subset of the invoice lines dataframe where \"slippers\" is contained in the description. Add a new column to this subset called \"Color\" that indicates the color of the slippers. Add another column called \"Size\" that indicates its size.\n",

    "\n",
