    "## About the data\n",
    "The data used in this assignment is a table built from the Human Resources schema of the Adventure Works 2019 database. This data contains information about each time that Employee Pay History was changed (each line is a pay rate change). It also contains information about the employee and the department they were working in when they received the pay rate listed.\n",

    "#### Final Thoughts\n",
    "In case you were curious, the value of the row with an outlier in `VacationHours` was originally `29` instead of `290`. That means that the error was most likely caused by a human who accidentally entered in an extra `0` on the end of the actual number. In any case, the average vacation hours among Sales Representatives turned out to be fairly close to this (`31.15`), meaning that imputation worked fairly well in this example."
