    "# Advanced Pandas Assignment 1\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will practice adding and removing rows and columns from Pandas dataframes. In addition, you will practice sorting dataframes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, you will perform the following exercises:\n",
    "1. Add and remove columns\n",
    "2. Add and remove rows\n",
    "3. Sort dataframes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note about assignments\n",
    "You can add lines of code according to your preferences. As long as the code required by the assignment is found in this notebook under the corresponding question header (ie. the answer to question 1 is underneath the title \"Question 1\"), you will receive credit for it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## About the data\n",
    "The data used in this assignment is a table built from the Human Resources schema of the Adventure Works 2019 database. This data contains information about each time that Employee Pay History was changed (each line is a pay rate change). It also contains information about the employee and the department they were working in when they received the pay rate listed.\n",
