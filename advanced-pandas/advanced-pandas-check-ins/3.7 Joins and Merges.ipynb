    "# 3.7 Joins and Merges\n",
    "\n",
    "Joining and merging in Pandas is essentially the same thing. If we remember from our SQL class, a **join** involves linking the rows of one table to the rows of another table based on primary key-foreign key relationships, where the primary key of one table is the foreign key of another table. Joining is often performed before the data is imported into Pandas because it is usually best to eliminate as much unnecessary data as early on in the data analysis process as possible, but sometimes, joining in Pandas is necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pandas dataframes have both a `.join()` method and a `.merge()` method. Both can perform the exact same operation-- however, the difference is that the `.join()` method always uses the dataframe index and `.merge()` allows the user to determine which columns to join on. In other words, the `.merge()` method is more flexible. In this course, we will be using the `.merge()` method only.\n",
    "\n",
    "### About the data\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook uses the classic *Titanic* data set, provided as a CSV file in the `data` folder. However, to demonstrate Pandas' ability to join tables together, a separate CSV file called `titanic_embarkment.csv` has been provided as well, which contains some data about embarkment locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's import Pandas and the data. Notice that the dataframe is called `titanic_df` and not just `df`, like before. This is because we will be joining several dataframes together and need to be able to distinguish between them."

    "The `titanic_df` is the same *Titanic* data set that we have been using throughout this course. However, you may have noticed that this data set doesn't have any foreign keys. That means that we cannot use a join in the same way that we are used to doing it with foreign and primary keys. Not separating tables into foreign keys and primary keys, however, is merely a database decision and should not prevent use from merging data onto our dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we are going to join on the `Embarked` column, using the letters `S`, `C`, and `Q` as foreign keys to another table that we will import below. In other words, we will be joining information about the embarked locations to our `titanic_df` using another table that has information about them.\n",
