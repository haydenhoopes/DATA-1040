    "You may have been thinking during this whole course, \"What's the point of cleaning my data in Pandas? I import the data, I explore the data, I clean it... and then what? How can I use Pandas to get the data in a format that I can use in my visualization software and reports?\"\n",

The dataset contains information about each passenger's passenger class, name, sex, age, siblings, parents/children, ticket number, ticket fare, cabin number, and the embarked location. It also contains information about each passenger's survival status. This data set is extremely popular among data scientists and will facilitate demonstrations of Pandas concepts.\n",
