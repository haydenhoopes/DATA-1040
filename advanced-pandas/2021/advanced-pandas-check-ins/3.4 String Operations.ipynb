    "# 3.4 String Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "With normal Python strings we can perform several functions to find the length of a string, get the last/first few letters, split the string into several strings, and check if a string contains a pattern of characters. Pandas also allows us to perform string operations on columns to extract additional information from textual data.\n",

    "### About the data\n",
    "​\n",
    "The data used in this notebook shows information about passengers on the *Titanic* cruiseliner, a ship which set out from Southampton, U.K. to sail across the Atlantic ocean and which tragically sank upon collision with an iceberg. The dataset contains information about each passenger's passenger class, name, sex, age, siblings, parents/children, ticket number, ticket fare, cabin number, and the embarked location. It also contains information about each passenger's survival status. This data set is extremely popular among data scientists and will facilitate demonstrations of Pandas concepts."

    "## Introduction\n",
    "When conducting data analysis, textual data is often one of the richest sources of information available to the analyst. Many times, text contains information about different dimensions that can be used to add dimensions to the data that can be aggregated in new, insightful ways. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A product description might include information about its color and type, allowing new columns to be created for color and type. This would allow aggregation across new dimensions to learn about the highest selling color or the most common type of product.\n",
    "2. Data about employees might include information about their hire dates, where the date is saved as a string. From this data, you could create columns for year and month and then find how the rate of new hires has changed over time.\n",
    "3. Manufacturing data might include codes like `M6C991` whose format might have a special meaning like \"Machine 6, Code 991\". Using string operations and this data, you could figure out the frequency that certain machines have errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before anything else, let's start by printing out the first five rows of the dataframe."

    "### Splitting a string\n",
    "Splitting strings is one of the more difficult parts of working with strings in Pandas. For example, observe that some of the passengers of the *Titanic* have a second name in parentheses. This is the passengers' actual name, whereas the name outside of the parentheses is their husbands' name. Let's use the `.str` accessor object and the `.split()` method to split all the names in the `Name` column by the left parenthesis `(` character. By doing this, the passengers that have a name in parentheses will have their husbands' names placed in the first item of the list and their actual names placed in the second item of the list. Passengers with just one name will have their name placed in a list as the first item.\n",
