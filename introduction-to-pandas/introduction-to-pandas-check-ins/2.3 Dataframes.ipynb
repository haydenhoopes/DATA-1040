    "# 2.3 Dataframes\n",
    "The Pandas library for Python organizes data into 2-dimensional structures called dataframes, a collection of columns and rows organized into a table-like format. Like normal data tables, columns of data are distributed across the x-axis, and rows are likewise distributed across the y-axis. Dataframes should be a fairly easy concept to comprehend if you have worked with programs like Microsoft Excel before.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataframe is a class created by the Pandas library, meaning that it comes equipped with special methods (functions) that it can use on itself to apply functions. The DataFrame is really essentially a dictionary of Series objects, where each Series represents a column and is formatted as a NumPy array (one value for each row of data). We'll talk about Series in the next section. \n",
    "\n",
    "For now, you can think of the key of each item in the dictionary as the column name, and the value of the item is an array of data representing the rows."
