Because Pandas is built on top of NumPy, we can slice a dataframe in the same way. You can select an individual column or a chunck of columns. You can also select an individual row or a chunk of rows.\n",

The dataset contains information about each passenger's passenger class, name, sex, age, siblings, parents/children, ticket number, ticket fare, cabin number, and the embarked location. It also contains information about each passenger's survival status. This data set is extremely popular among data scientists and will facilitate demonstrations of Pandas concepts.\n",
