    "# Pandas Assignment 1\n",
    "In this assignment you will practice working with Pandas dataframes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, you will be carrying out the following excercises:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import data from a CSV file.\n",
    "2. Describe and get information from dataframes.\n",
    "3. Collect observations of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note about assignments\n",
    "You can add lines of code according to you preferences. As long as the code required by the assignment is found in this notebook file, you will receive credit for it regardless of the presence of additional code. You will lose points for removing starting code if it prevents the notebook from running correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## About the data\n",
    "The data used in this assignment is a table built from the Human Resources schema of the Adventure Works 2019 database. This data contains information about each time that Employee Pay History was changed (each line is a pay rate change). It also contains information about the employee and the department they were working in when they received the pay rate listed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The actual data is stored in a `.csv` file located inside the `data` directory. The file is called `pay_history.csv`."
